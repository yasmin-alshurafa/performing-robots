# Assignment 3: Questions Response

Choose a short scene from a play and a character in that scene, and consider how you would make a robot actor to perform that scene. Any spoken words will come from a human or a computer, not from your actor.
How would you build the actor?
What technical features will the actor need?
How will you construct the actor to create the role?
How will you decorate or dress the actor for best effect?
What sequence of moves or other actions will you give your actor so that they can best play the part?
