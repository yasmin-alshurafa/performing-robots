## Digital Theatre by Nadja Masura

"One of the most utilized Digital Theatre effects is the video other or the Actor’s Double. The idea of doubling the actor onstage with his own image lends an air of the uncanny and self-introspection" 138

- The idea of the Actor's double reminded me of the conversation we had about an identical robot to a human. It would have the same idea of a double actor. 

"The continued exploration of mechanical/biological différance allows us to better define and understand ourselves" 142

- I really liked what the quote claims about understanding oneself. This is because oftentimes when it comes to interacting with a robot we often look to understand or reflect and examine ways to improve the robots and we tend to forget ourselves. However, in this quote these difference between humans and robots when it comes to digital theatre allows us to understand ourselves and reflect upon our function.

"In each of these examples the purely digital actor or agent—be it animated projection, robot, android, or AI—exists side by side with the human element" 150

- This argument made me wonder if one day the human element won't stand side by side with the digital actors.

"A few practitioners today are experimenting with various forms of digital actors alongside human actors, allowing the digital to step forward into the performance as a character and become a central element in telling a story" 121

- Author mentions in this quote that practitioners want digital actors to become a central element. So, this made me wonder what benefit would we gain in making them the center element, and why would we make them the center of the element when we have humans to do that?
