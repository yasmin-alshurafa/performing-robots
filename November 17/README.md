# Assignment 6: Reading Response

## Digital Theatre by Nadja Masura

- "One of the most utilized Digital Theatre effects is the video other or the Actor’s Double. The idea of doubling the actor onstage with his own image lends an air of the uncanny and self-introspection" 138

The idea of the Actor's double reminded me of the conversation we had about an identical robot to a human. It would have the same idea of a double actor. 

- "The continued exploration of mechanical/biological différance allows us to better define and understand ourselves" 142

I really liked what the quote claims about understanding oneself. This is because oftentimes when it comes to interacting with a robot we often look to understand or reflect and examine ways to improve the robots and we tend to forget ourselves. However, in this quote these difference between humans and robots when it comes to digital theatre allows us to understand ourselves and reflect upon our function.
