# Assignment 7: Reading Response

## The Freudian Robot: Digital Media and the Future of the Unconscious by Lydia H. Liu 

"This elementary distinction explains why a robot, even without the benefit of consciousness, is capable of greater intelligence and of more dazzling performances than any specialized automaton" (page 1)

- This sentence made me wonder, what if a robot had the benefit of consciousness, how will it perform and act?

"Why should a machine be made to resemble or duplicate a human being?" (page 2)

- I don't have an answer for this question but it makes me think why not. It isn't a puzzle-like the author says. However, for every person, it'll be different depending on what the robot that resembles human beings will be used as.

'The etymology of the word “robot,” which originally denotes “slave” through its association with the Czech word robota, meaning “compulsory labor"' (page 4)

- I find this conversation quite interesting about robots being slaves. This is because a lot of people tend to see robots as new slaves for instance the Roomba robot, that cleans the floor. However, at the same time, thinking beyond robots that perform tasks that are linked to slavery, for instance, musical robots. This shows how people who link the idea of robots being slaves to humans very limited. Robots go beyond the idea of doing tasks for humans but allow humans to explore different fields and possibilities with robots.

'The cyborg is “a cybernetic organism, a hybrid of machine and organism, a creature of social reality as well as a creature of fiction"' (page 7)

- The idea of the cyborg is very interesting for me. I don't know how and why it is linked to being a social reality but I do know that it has been used as a creature of fiction in different movies. It is also interesting to look at how this term is linked to humans in the current time. People with implants like artificial heart values are sometimes called cyborgs. Also, people who wear technological items or use technologies like mobile phones are called cyborgs. I believe that in the future, I do imagine more humans being called cyborgs and it being normal.
