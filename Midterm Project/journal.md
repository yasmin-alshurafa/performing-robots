- Today I worked on brainstorming potential ideas I can work on for the project. I decided to create a figure that is controlled by different buttons. The figure will include colored LEDs, Servo motors, and DC gear motors. Once a button is triggered, the LED will turn on, the servo motor will move a signal, and the DC gear motors will move. Each button will trigger a certain expression depending on the color. For instance, if the red button was pushed, the red led will turn on, the Servo motor will move with a signal that holds the word I'm mad and the DC gear motor will move in a manner that shows that the figure is mad.

- An image of how the robot will kind of look like:

- Today I wired up all the components I needed and tested that they were working using the built-in example. I wired up the 3 buttons and test them out using the DigitalReadSerial example and they all worked. I attached the first radio to the Arduino that has the buttons connected and by that I had my first Arduino ready. The Arduino with the buttons will be that one used to control the working components attached to the other Arduino.

- This is how the first Arduino with the buttons and the radio turned out:

- I wired up the 3 Servo motors and tested them out using the Sweep example. They all worked.

- I wired up the LEDs and tested them out using the Blink example. They all worked.
