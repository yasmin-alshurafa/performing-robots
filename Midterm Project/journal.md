### Oct 3:

- Today I worked on brainstorming potential ideas I can work on for the project. I decided to create a figure that is controlled by different buttons. The figure will include colored LEDs, Servo motors, and DC gear motors. Once a button is triggered, the LED will turn on, the servo motor will move a signal, and the DC gear motors will move. Each button will trigger a certain expression depending on the color. For instance, if the red button was pushed, the red led will turn on, the Servo motor will move with a signal that holds the word I'm mad and the DC gear motor will move in a manner that shows that the figure is mad.

- An image of how the robot will kind of look like:
