# Sneezy Dwarf Robot


## Description:

Aalya and I brainstormed ideas for our sneezy dwarf robot together. We want to build a dancing-sneezy robot. So while the robot is moving around and dancing, it stops for a while slightly moving backward, dropping the head and sneezing. To do that we will have a servo motor to drop the head down. Also, two servo motors for the arms to dance. The arms of the robot will also carry tissue and move towards the face of the robot when it sneezes. We will be using a neopixel for the face to create some facial expressions. Finally, we will have the robot carry a tissue box, have a constant red nose, and maybe wear a yellow hat to make the robot stand out and be known but the audience once looked at it.
