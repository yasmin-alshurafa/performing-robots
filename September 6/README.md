## Autonomous Robots As Performing Agents by Karl Wurst and Robert McCartney

The article touches upon the idea of how autonomous robots can be performing agents. As performing agents are there to entertain the audience; autonomous robots carry a similar job. However, what makes the autonomous robots special is that each robot "combine[s] techniques from artificial intelligence, robotics, and puppetry" to perform which are characteristics that set them apart from traditional performing agents (Wurst and McCartney 56). 

The communication element seems to play an essential role in the autonomous robots whether it was among other performers themselves, the director, or the audience in general. I believe this is because interaction is a vital characteristic of autonomous robots and for it to be a successful interaction, proper communication should be available in its different forms.

An interesting thought that came to my mind while I was reading is how simple yet complex communication can be. In some forms of communication and for certain people in different contexts communicating verbally for instance can be very easy. However, when taking the example of the Woggles, where the medium of communicating between these agents is physical gestures which seems to be simple, yet it is complex to the degree where communications protocol should be developed.

It is funny how everything nowadays is moving from being physical into being virtual. However, the Woggles are being moved to becoming physical rather than virtual. 




A question the article left me thinking of is the difference between actors, performers, and performing agents. I believe that the performers’ focus is often the audience and what reactions they make. While on the other hand, the actors’ focus is often primarily on the scene and the context of the material provided. If what I believe is correct, then are the Woggles performers or actors?
