Be prepared to discuss. Prepare questions, observations, and reactions in a short README.md in a new folder called November8 in your Github repository.

Propose an idea for a robot play or a scene from a play.
Your play may use one or more robots that we will build
One or two robot dogs (Boston Dynamic Spot)
Your play may be based on a play that already exists or you may make up something on your own
Consider why a robot should perform in this role. Some suggestions:
Can robots be used to explore topics that are too difficult for humans (e.g. difficult conversations)?
Can robots be used to explore human-robot coexistence (an idea mentioned in Katie's presentation today)?
Write this up in the same README.md mentioned above
Include sketches or pictures of robots and/or scenery if you wish. Hand drawn is fine.
